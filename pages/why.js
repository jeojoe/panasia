          <p>Both our couplers and threads are neatly designed by an expert who has been constantly researching and developing the technology for more than 20 years.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unlike others, our couplers are remarkably strong because they are made from special material and clever design.</li>
            <li>The combination of soft cold-forged technology and reinforced parallel thread-rolling process results in perfect quality threads for connection.</li>
            <li>Our process does not reduce cross-section area of a bar so it does not weaken bar strength.</li>
            <li>Our process does not excessively enlarge a bar so it does not upset a barâ€™s core, preventing undesirable cracks.</li>
            <li>Our process does not destroy strong hard surface of a bar nor creating sharp corners that are prone to crack like the infamous cutting thread technique.</li>
